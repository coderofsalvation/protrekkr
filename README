This is a fork of ProTrekkr which has not been update in some time. 

Changes in this repo are:

Nasty makefile hacks to get windows version building
DevC++ project files resulting from build attempts

I am not a developer, and this should not be considered a viable fork-point. That said, any pull requests to help this quirky tracker survive would be greatly appreciated!

Intentions:

UI clean up and enlargment
Better font

Make beats
